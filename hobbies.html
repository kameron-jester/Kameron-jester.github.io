        <h2>Things I Love to Do</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Traveling</h3>
                <p>I love exploring new places, trying new foods, and immersing myself in different cultures. Last spring break, I had the incredible opportunity to visit <strong>London and Dublin</strong>, where I enjoyed sightseeing, learning about the history, and experiencing local traditions. I’ve also traveled to <strong>Mexico</strong>, soaking in the vibrant culture and beautiful landscapes. So far, I’ve been to <strong>11 U.S. states</strong>, and my travel bucket list keeps growing—I can’t wait for my next adventure!</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Hot Yoga</h3>
                <p>For over <strong>two years</strong>, I’ve been practicing hot yoga at  
                   <a href="https://realhotyoga.net" target="_blank"><strong>Real Hot Yoga in Kenosha, WI</strong></a>,  
                   and it has become such an important part of my life. It’s my time to focus on myself, challenge my body, and clear my mind. 
                   The supportive community at my studio makes every class even more rewarding. One of my favorite poses is <strong>Warrior 3</strong>—it makes me feel strong, balanced, and empowered. 
                   No matter how my day is going, yoga always leaves me feeling refreshed and grounded.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Volunteering</h3>
                <p>Giving back has always been something I’m passionate about. I love being part of projects that make a direct impact in people’s lives. Two of my favorite experiences have been volunteering with <strong>Feed My Starving Children</strong>, where I helped pack meals for children in need, and <strong>Sleep in Heavenly Peace</strong>, where I helped build and deliver beds for kids who don’t have a place to sleep. There’s nothing more fulfilling than knowing you’ve helped brighten someone’s life, even in a small way.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Podcasts & Audiobooks</h3>
                <p>Whether I’m walking between classes, driving, or just relaxing, I love listening to podcasts and audiobooks as a way to unwind and escape into a great story. I enjoy <strong>true crime, personal development, and inspiring real-life stories</strong>. One of my all-time favorite podcasts is <strong>Crime Junkies</strong>—I’m always hooked on the suspenseful cases! My most recent favorite audiobook is <strong>From Here to the Great Unknown</strong> by Lisa Marie Presley and Riley Keough, which was both emotional and deeply inspiring.</p>
